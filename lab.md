# From Fab Lab to Bio Lab
This page shows the process of conversion of The Beach Lab into a _Bio Laboratory_, well, sort of. But the truth is that it can help you as a starting point to decide what to buy or fabricate, how to set up the layout and some other things I am struggling.

## Dedicated space
Based in my experience in fab labs and after taking HTGAA I can tell you that **you will need a ~~clean room~~ dedicated space** for HTGAA and perform bio experiments. I mean, you cannot do all those things near the shopbot or let the visitors and kids tampering with micropipettes and some other sensitive equipment. I think the best is idea is to **build a small bio-dedicated kitchen inside the lab**. It might be open in a _clean_ area. I would also put a sticker nearby with a scary biohazard sign, maybe a poster of the movie 28 weeks later. That should keep the snoops away. This bio-kitchen should have:

* Sink with a source of ultrapure water
* Chemical resistant countertop with 2 meters of free space. If you can afford a _Corian_ one that would be awesome.
* Exhaust that you can use as a chemical hood.
* Dedicated biofridge and Freezer
* Drawers and cabinets for the equipment
* A heating source with temperature control
* Microwave oven

## Best practices
* Keep an updated list of chemicals that you have with all the MSDS (Safety Data Sheets)
* Inform your local authorities of the activities you will be doing, so they don't freak out the day there is an emergency in your place
* Find out the regulations of your area, you will modify DNA on a living organism

## Equipment

### Things to buy

#### Micropipettes and pipeting tips
There is a lot of **tiny** liquid handling in synthetic biology. We are dealing with microliters here, down to 0.2 microliters. For reference a drop of water is about 50 microliters. And for that you need a special piece of equipment called micropipette. At this stage I would say this is way too complex to fabricate in a fab lab, so because they are not too expensive (around 40 EUR each) and you only need 4 to 5 I am just going to order them. The people from PRBB only uses Gilson Pipetman micropipettes, they don't want to use anything else.

Common micropipette size | Volume
--- | ---
P2 | 0.2 - 2 uL
P20 | 2 - 20 uL
P100 | 20 - 100 uL
P1000 | 100 - 1000 uL
P200 | 50 - 200 uL (optional)
