## Broadcasting Francisco's HTGAA chronicles from The Beach Lab

# Francisco's Assignments
My name is Francisco Sanchez Arroyo, I am the founder of [The Beach Lab](http://beachlab.org), a Fab Lab located in Sitges, Spain. Here you can find my personal experience in the first, messy and crazy edition of [HTGAA'15](http://bio.academany.org) (How to Grow Almost Anything). Documentation covers the assignments and also setting up the lab and the (unexpected) process of learning about genetics and biology. If you need to reach me, drop me a note at <me@beachlab.org>.

> I am updating and improving the documentation during HTGAA'16. Since the web hook is disconnected you can find the most up-to-date version at [http://htgaa.beachlab.org](http://htgaa.beachlab.org).
