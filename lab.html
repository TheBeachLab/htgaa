<p>This page shows the process of conversion of The Beach Lab into a <em>Bio Laboratory</em>, well, sort of. But the truth is that it can help you as a starting point to decide what to buy or fabricate, how to set up the layout and some other things I am struggling.</p>
<h2 id="dedicated-space">Dedicated space</h2>
<p>Based in my experience in fab labs and after taking HTGAA I can tell you that <strong>you will need a <del>clean room</del> dedicated space</strong> for HTGAA and perform bio experiments. I mean, you cannot do all those things near the shopbot or let the visitors and kids tampering with micropipettes and some other sensitive equipment. I think the best is idea is to <strong>build a small bio-dedicated kitchen inside the lab</strong>. It might be open in a <em>clean</em> area. I would also put a sticker nearby with a scary biohazard sign, maybe a poster of the movie 28 weeks later. That should keep the snoops away. This bio-kitchen should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sink with a source of ultrapure water</li>
<li>Chemical resistant countertop with 2 meters of free space. If you can afford a <em>Corian</em> one that would be awesome.</li>
<li>Exhaust that you can use as a chemical hood.</li>
<li>Dedicated biofridge and Freezer</li>
<li>Drawers and cabinets for the equipment</li>
<li>A heating source with temperature control</li>
<li>Microwave oven</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-practices">Best practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep an updated list of chemicals that you have with all the MSDS (Safety Data Sheets)</li>
<li>Inform your local authorities of the activities you will be doing, so they don't freak out the day there is an emergency in your place</li>
<li>Find out the regulations of your area, you will modify DNA on a living organism</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot of <strong>tiny</strong> liquid handling in synthetic biology. We are dealing with microliters here, down to 0.2 microliters. For reference a drop of water is about 50 microliters. And for that you need a special piece of equipment called micropipette. At this stage I would say this is way too complex to fabricate in a fab lab, so because they are not too expensive (around 40 EUR each) and you only need 4 to 5 I am just going to order them. The people from PRBB only uses Gilson Pipetman micropipettes, they don't want to use anything else.</p>
